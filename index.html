		<p class="indent">Terrance Stanley "Terry" Fox CC OD (July 28, 1958 – June 28, 1981) was a Canadian athlete, humanitarian, and cancer research activist.</p> <p class="indent">In 1980, with one leg having been amputated, he embarked on a cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and 5,373 kilometres (3,339 mi), and ultimately cost him his life, his efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy.</p><p class="indent"> The annual Terry Fox Run, first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over C$650 million has been raised in his name.</p><div>
		<p class="quote indent">“It took cancer to realize that being self-centered is not the way to live. The answer is to try and help others.”</br>- Terrance Stanley "Terry" Fox</p><p class="indent"> You can involve or contribute to the Terry Fox Foundation <a href="http://www.terryfox.org" title="Terry Fox Foundation" target="_blank">Here</a>
